## Tech

This Star Wars Characters App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React] - a JS library for building user interfaces!
* [React.lazy] - to render React components dynamically
* [Redux] - a predictable state container for JS apps
* [Redux Thunk] - Redux middleware
* [Tachyons] - to style much easier and faster
